Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx must be replaced
-/+ resource "docker_container" "nginx" {

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
