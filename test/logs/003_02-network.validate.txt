│ Warning: Reference to undefined provider
│
│   on main.tf line 220, in module "virtual_network_peering":
│  220:     azurerm.src = azurerm
│
│ There is no explicit declaration for local provider name "azurerm.src" in module.virtual_network_peering, so Terraform is assuming you mean to pass a configuration for "hashicorp/azurerm".
│
│ If you also control the child module, add a required_providers entry named "azurerm.src" with the source address "hashicorp/azurerm".
│
│ (and one more similar warning elsewhere)
╵
Success! The configuration is valid, but there were some
validation warnings as shown above.
